# Dataset Card for Annual Transportation Usage in Istanbul, 2022

<!-- Provide a quick summary of the dataset. -->
The dataset we created consists of merged datasets of 12 months, all shared by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
<!--{{ dataset_summary | default("", true) }}-->

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this dataset is. -->
Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality shares transportation usage monthly. All 12 months of 2022 were merged into this final one. The set has nearly 7.5 million rows and consists of hourly usage of 877 transportation lines (highway and rail type) in a year. The information of football matches that were played in Istanbul of the teams Beşiktaş, Galatasaray, and Fenerbahçe was added but didn't help the performance of the model and therefore dropped from the final set. Temperature was also added and used to train our models but it also didn't affect the models' performance. Both initial set and training set will be shared.

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the dataset is intended to be used. -->
Can be used to understand the trends overtime

### Direct Use

<!-- This section describes suitable use cases for the dataset. -->
- **Prediction of Route Usage:** The dataset can be employed to train models aimed at predicting the usage of transportation routes over time. This predictive capability can be valuable for optimizing various aspects of transportation planning, such as determining optimal departure times, adjusting the frequency of vehicles, and even informing the creation of new routes.

- **Planning and Optimization:** The predictions derived from the trained models can be utilized for strategic planning and optimization of transportation services. By gaining insights into usage patterns, transportation authorities and companies can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, scheduling, and route planning.

- **Performance Monitoring:** The dataset can also serve as a valuable tool for monitoring the performance of transportation routes. By analyzing historical data, one can identify trends, peak usage periods, and areas that may require additional attention or adjustments in service.

- **Research and Analysis:** Researchers and analysts can leverage the dataset to conduct studies and analyses on various aspects of public transportation, contributing to a deeper understanding of travel patterns, user behavior, and the factors influencing transportation demand.

## Dataset Creation

### Source Data

<!-- This section describes the source data (e.g. news text and headlines, social media posts, translated sentences, ...). -->
Individual passengers traveling in the given hour is calculated by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. 
#### Data Collection and Processing

<!-- This section describes the data collection and processing process such as data selection criteria, filtering and normalization methods, tools and libraries used, etc. -->
12 months of hourly data was merged into one. 
For the temperature data we utilized [meteoblue](meteoblue.com/) and for the match data, [wikipedia](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021-22_S%C3%BCper_Lig_ma%C3%A7lar%C4%B1) was used. Initial dataset had marine routes as well but only railway and highway data was used due to errors in the tags of marine lines.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->
For better analysis and a better demand planning system, usage information for each stop of the routes is needed. However, in order to track each stop, cameras or other sensors must be utilized since citizens don't have to use their transport cards while leaving transportation vehicles. 
Since individual stop data is not available, popular locations can't be extracted from the dataset. This can later affect the bias of the models.
